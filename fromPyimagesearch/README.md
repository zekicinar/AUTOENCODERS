In this folder, you will find examples about autoencoders. For protection of reference blogâ€™s rights, I do not add images and weights which are given by them. I just add some of results from my notebooks. Keywords and concepts of notebooks are given below : 


1.)	Intro to anomaly detection with OpenCV : Isolation forest model, anomaly detection with histogram and opencv

2.)	Autoencoder with Keras : mnist dataset, build autoencoder with keras, plot model

3.)	Denoise autoencoder: mnist dataset, autoencoder for denoise image, create noisy images

4.)	Anomaly detection with Keras : autoencoder for anomaly detection with mnist dataset

5.)	Content_based Image Retrieval : use autoencoder for CBIR, mnist dataset
